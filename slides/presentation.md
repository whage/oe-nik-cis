# The challenge
- 6D pose estimation - how?

# The data
["Ex-vivo dVRK segmentation dataset with kinematic data"](ucl-page)
- "ex-vivo": outisde of a living organism - "not inside"
- "dVRK":  “open-source mechatronics” system, consisting of electronics, firmware, and software
that is being used to control research systems based on the now retired first-generation da Vinci system
- "surgical tool segmentation": separate the tool from the background on the 2D image
- "kinematic data":

#  Original paper
The data is associated with the 2020 MICCA paper
[“Synthetic and Real Inputs for Tool Segmentation in Robotic Surgery”](orig-paper).
The paper introduces a deep learning based approach to surgical tool segmentation based on
both the laparoscopic camera images and the images generated by a simulation of the da Vinci robot

# Structure of the data
- images
- green screen & ground truth
- kinematic data
